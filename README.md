# Unstable_Rotation

Unstable_Rotation is a MATLAB program that generates a phase sphere of radius 1 showing the trajectories of rotation of a free rigid body flipped about its three principal axes.

## Usage

To use, run in MATLAB.

The relationship between the principal axes can be changed by modifying the value i_1, i_2, and i_3 in the function ydot, which represent the three moments of inertia along the principal axes.

Unstable rotation will only be observed when the three moments of inertia are unique.
